# Database

The sql file included here gives an overview of the tables included in the current RRC(RedRiver Chat) database configuration. Included are also 100 test users, from sTestUser0 up to sTestUser 99. See the wiki for more information.

Note that ASP.NET Core should create this database automatically as long as the settings in appsettings.json are correct - so this sql file should never be needed.
